    Launches the coroutine as an asyncio task and sets the done
    callback to :func:`exit_on_error() <.exit_on_error()>`. This is "safe"
    because it will ensure exceptions inside the task get logged and cause
    the program to exit. Otherwise, background tasks that are not awaited
    may not have their exceptions raised such that programs hang with no
    notice of the exception that caused the hang.

    Tasks can raise :class:`SafeTaskExit <SafeTaskExit>` to signal the task
    is finished but should not cause a system exit.
