# OroAutoGrammar Package

# Project Title

A Python package that automatically generates grammar aware Oromo phrases from a given raw text.

## Description

This is a novel python package that recieves an Oromo text file from a user; extract every possible root-verbs from the text;
and stores them into a python list. It then trims all the verbs in the list to form their corresponding list of stems.
Finally, the algorithm builds the corresponding phrases from the stems using an appropriate affixation and personal pronouns. 
The package can be customized and be repicated for any other languages according to the gramatical structure of the language.
It helps relief machine learning and NLP practitioners,by automatically generating a clean and grammar aware dataset,which was 
used to be done only manually. The generated Oromo phrases can indicate sentence elements like, number, gender and cases. The 
automatically generated Oromo phrases can be applied to different machine learning applications. It can form a clean phrase-based
dataset that can help to train a Neural Machine Translation (NMT). It can also form a word and phrase-based dictionery, that will
help in automatic word/sentence completion. The output of this tool is also helpful for Linguistics, in providing a clean and
correct gramatical information of the language.
