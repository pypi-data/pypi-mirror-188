# HTTPServerPY: A lightweight static HTTP server written in Python

## Introduction

`HTTPServerPY` is a simple, zero-configuration command-line static HTTP server.

## Installation:

#### Globally via `pip`

    pip install HTTPServerPY

This will install `HTTPServerPY` globally so that it may be run from the command line anywhere.

## Usage:

    py -m HTTPServerPY [host] [port] [path] [options]

`[host]` defaults localhost | 0.0.0.0.
`[port]` defaults 8000.
`[path]` defaults to the current directory `./`.

*Now you can visit http://localhost:8080 to view your server*

## Available Options:

| Command         | 	Description         | Defaults  |
| -------------  |-------------|-------------|------|
|`-p` or `--port` |Port to use. Use `-p=8080` to serve at 8080 port| 8000 |
|`-h` or `--host` |Host to use. Use `-h=0.0.0.0` to serve at localhost | 0.0.0.0 |
|`-pth` or `--path` |Path to serve from. Use `--path=./my_folder` to serve from `my_folder` present in current folder| ./ |

## Magic Files

- `index.html` will be served as the default file to any directory requests.
- `404.html` will be served if a file is not found.
- `405.html` will be served if a requested method is not supported.

*Now you can visit http://localhost:8080 to view your server*
