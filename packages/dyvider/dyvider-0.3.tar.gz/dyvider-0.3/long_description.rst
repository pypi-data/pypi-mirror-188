dyvider
=======

**dyvider** is a small library implementing dynamic programming
algorithms for exact linear clustering in networks. Its algorithms
process networks whose nodes have positions in one dimension, and return
their optimal partition.

The theory and experiments exploring this code can be found in the paper
`"Exact and rapid linear clustering of networks with dynamic programming" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10403>`__, 
by `Alice Patania <https://alpatania.github.io/>`__, `Antoine Allard <https://antoineallard.github.io/>`__ 
and `Jean-Gabriel Young <https://jg-you.github.io/>`__.


Dependencies
------------

The only necessary dependency are
`networkx <https://networkx.org/>`__ and ``numpy``.

Quick tour
----------

The following minimal example first assigns scores to nodes with a
one-dimensional spectral embedding and then retrieves an optimal linear
clustering from this embedding using ``dyvider``.

.. code:: python

   import networkx as nx
   import dyvider as dy
   import numpy as np

   # create a graph
   g = nx.stochastic_block_model([10, 10], [[0.5, 0.05], [0.05, 0.5]], seed=42)

   # generate a 1-d embedding with the leading eigenvector of the modularity matrix
   eigenvals, eigvenvecs = np.linalg.eig(nx.linalg.adjacency_matrix(g).todense())
   score = {v: float(eigvenvecs[v, 0]) for v in g.nodes()}

   # set the node positions
   nx.set_node_attributes(g, score, 'score')

   # run dyvider
   g = dy.utilities.preprocess(g)
   objective_function = dy.objectives.Modularity()
   solution, Q = dy.algorithms.run(g, objective_function)

   print(solution)

The expected output is:

.. code:: python

   >>> [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]] 

Our `tutorial <tutorial.ipynb>`__ goes into more detail and demonstrates
all the API calls.
