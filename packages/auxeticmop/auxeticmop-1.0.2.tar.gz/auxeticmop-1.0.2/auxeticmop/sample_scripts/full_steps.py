    """
    <!> Caution
    You must use if __name__ == '__main__' for running GA,
    If __name__=='__main__' is not used, multiple servers are running and multiple bindings occur on the same port,
    which causes OSError: [WinError 10048] server-binding error. The reason this phenomenon occurs is as follows.

    [1] Some functions like make_and_start_process() and 'start_abaqus_cae() creates new process.
    [2] If creating process using multiprocessing.Process(), that process will run the code at the top level of the script.
    [3] If you have code that you only want to run when the script is run directly, you can put it in the block of code
    indented under if __name__ == '__main__':, so that it will not be executed when the script is imported as a module and
    run in a new process. Without that condition, the same block of code will run multiple times in multiple processes
    which can lead to unexpected results.
