# Sybil  Checks Package 

`pip install SybilChecks`

` from SybilChecks import checks`

### Intro

This package was developed during ODC Data Builders Hackathon on Jan-2023, [OpenData Community](https://opendatacommunity.org/) . It intends to make it easier to do first basic checks on donors of public funds rounds. It can integrate systems of risk analysis as a ‘Lego’ for feature engineering or as a start for further data analysis on wallets. It cointans 5 functions, 4 of them tests behaviours and flags booleans outputs for the behaviour tested ,and 1 returns a dataset of historical transactional data till the current date. 

The idea is to make it easier to do basic tests around participants and flags suspicious behaviours that could culminate in Sybil identification. 


### How it works

The package was created using [Covalent API](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/api/#/0/0/USD/1)  therefore it is imperative that the users get an [<api_key>](https://www.covalenthq.com/) , as it is a necessary  variable on every function. 

Functions variables :     
	*wallet_id* = type: ‘str’, wallet address that will be evaluated    
	*api_key* = type: ‘str’, your covalent api_key   
	*chain_id* = type: ‘str’, covalent id for the network you want the historical transactions    
	*round_start* = type: ‘str’, format : ‘%Y-%m-%d’,  date of the round start or date when the round was announced. Example : ‘2022-12-05’   
  *round_finish* =  type: ‘str’, format : ‘%Y-%m-%d’,  date of the round end or date when donors were not able to make donations anymore. Example : ‘2022-12-31’    
  *list_for_testing* = type : ‘list’, present on the `wallet_initiated ` module, it should contain a list of unique wallet addresses of donors and grantees but not the wallet tested .   
  *list_of_donors* =  type : ‘list’, present on the `trx_between_donors`  module, it should contain a list of unique wallet addresses of donors .    
  *wallets_lists* = type : ‘list’, present on the `wallet_historical_trx`  module, it should contains all wallets address that is intended to get the lifetime transactional data on the specified `chain_id`   



### Fuctions:     


`first_trx_during_round(wallet_id, api_key, chain_id, round_start, round_finish)`:      
	Function tests if the wallet was ‘initiated’ (tried its first transaction), on the specific chain tested,  during the period specified. This module does not distinguish between failed or successful transactions. Output: list['wallet_id', True/False]

`wallet_initiated(wallet_id, api_key, chain_id, list_for_testing)` :    
	Function tests if the first funds were received by one of the wallets in the <list_for_testing> variable . It returns ‘True’ only if the first successful and not ‘0’ value transaction was made by some of the wallets in the list. Output: list['wallet_id', True/False]

 Example:     
	Trx_1 : from x_wallet / successful : False / value: 1 (function will discart)     
	Trx_2 : from x_wallet / successful : True / value: 0 (function will discart)    
	Trx_3 : from n_wallet / successful : True / value: 10 (function will accept)    
	If  `list_for_testing` contains  'n_wallet' then module returns `True`    



`trx_between_donors(wallet_id, api_key, chain_id, list_of_donors)` :    
	 Function tests if round donors have transitioned between themselves, there is not distinction between successful and failed transactions nor about when these transactions occurred.  In this module `wallet_id` must be in `list_of_donors`. Output: list['wallet_id', True/False]

`donors_trx_during_round(wallet_id, api_key, chain_id, round_start, round_finish, list_of_donors)` :     
	 Function tests if round donors have transitioned between themselves during the period of grant round or announcement of the round, there is no distinction between successful and failed transactions.   wallet_id must be in list_of_donors. Output: list['wallet_id', True/False]

`wallet_historical_trx(wallets_list , api_key, chain_id)`:    
	This function was developed to make it easier to get historical transactional data from a list of wallets. It bridges the gap between the API usage and a final treated dataset. 


### Further development:    

The package has little study around time optimization due to hackathon time constraints. It can be slow when used to check a lot of wallets  owing to  making one API call for each function ‘check’. Further development would include:       

  * modules to import and treat a dataset and use it to retrieve the validations for the other modules.
  * One module that builds and processes networks algorithms and returns network metrics as degree of centrality, closeness and so on ..

* Simon from [ 0x9simon ](https://twitter.com/csctgrace/status/1605835545040412673) due to his discussion around Gas Provision Network. It inspired the construction of the module ‘wallet_initiated’
