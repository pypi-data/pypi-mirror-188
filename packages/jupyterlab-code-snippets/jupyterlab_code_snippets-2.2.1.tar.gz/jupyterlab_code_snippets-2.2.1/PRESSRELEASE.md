## **JupyterLab Code Snippets empowers you to write code more rapidly**

Do you find yourself typing in the same code blocks over and over again? Are you tired of clicking through tabs online for starter code or browsing old notebook files to find the right import statements? Save, reuse, and share code snippets using JupyterLab Code Snippets! In the past, you would spend more time scouring the internet than actually working. Searching old code for snippets is like searching for your lost keys; it’s frustrating!

JupyterLab Code Snippets allows you to create and store code snippets that can be inserted into any JupyterLab workspace and save you from the hassle of typing repetitive code. Code snippets are pieces of code or individual cells that are frequently used. Simply browse or search snippets in the Snippets panel to use wherever you need in JupyterLab.

Using JupyterLab code snippets is easy! Simply open the snippet explorer and browse through the provided predefined code snippets. Still can’t find what you need? Simply highlight code and right-click to save as a snippet or drag cells into the panel. Find snippets by utilizing the search, filter, and preview features. For a fresh start, select the plus icon in the snippet panel to construct a completely new, custom snippet. Also, edit your snippet quickly at any time by clicking the edit icon on the snippet. To use your snippets, you can drag and drop a code snippet to insert it as a cell or press the insert icon on the snippet to inject the code where your cursor is located within the JupyterLab workspace.
