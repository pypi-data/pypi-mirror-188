**Function decoration for backoff and retry**

This is a fork of an excellent Python library
[backoff](https://github.com/litl/backoff). The library was forked on January 26, 2023.
It includes the original version 2.2.1 (October 5, 2022) and a few extra updates.

This fork includes 2 PRs proposed in the original repo:

-   [Correct check for max\_time parameter](https://github.com/litl/backoff/pull/130)
-   [Fix some issues around max\_time in \_next\_wait](https://github.com/litl/backoff/pull/136)
-   [Using \"timeit\" module for time management](https://github.com/litl/backoff/pull/185)

The updated behavior of `max_time` is that a a function will be retried only if the elapsed time is less,
than `max_time`. Also the remaining time should exceed the `interval` (delay between retries).

The code that calculates delay time was modified to not generate negative values.
If at the time of calculation elapsed time exceeds specified `max_time` value than delay is set to zero.
If calculated delay time is negative, then it's also set to zero.

In order to use this module import it under `backoff` alias and use it
the same way as the original module

```python
import improved_backoff as backoff

@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, requests.exceptions.RequestException)
def get_url(url):
    return requests.get(url)
```
