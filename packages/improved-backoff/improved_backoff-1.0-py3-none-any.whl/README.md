**Function decoration for backoff and retry**

This is a fork of an excellent Python library
[backoff](https://github.com/litl/backoff). The library was forked from
version 2.2.1 (October 5, 2022) This version includes 2 PRs proposed in
the original repo:

-   [Correct check for max\_time
    parameter](https://github.com/litl/backoff/pull/130)
-   [Using \"timeit\" module for time
    management](https://github.com/litl/backoff/pull/185)

In order to use this module import it under `backoff` alias and use it
the same way as the original module

```python
import improved_backoff as backoff

@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, requests.exceptions.RequestException)
def get_url(url):
    return requests.get(url)
```
