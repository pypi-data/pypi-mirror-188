Buttplug-py is a python implementation of the Client of the Buttplug Sex Toy Control Protocol.
It allows users to write applications that can connect to Buttplug Servers, such as
[Intiface Central](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-central) or
[Intiface CLI](https://github.com/intiface/intiface-engine).
