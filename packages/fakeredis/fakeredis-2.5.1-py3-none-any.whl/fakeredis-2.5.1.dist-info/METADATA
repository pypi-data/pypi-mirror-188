# Intro

fakeredis is a pure-Python implementation of the redis-py python client
that simulates talking to a redis server. This was created for a single
purpose: **to write tests**. Setting up redis is not hard, but
many times you want to write tests that do not talk to an external server
(such as redis). This module now allows tests to simply use this
module as a reasonable substitute for redis.

For a list of supported/unsupported redis commands, see [REDIS_COMMANDS.md](./REDIS_COMMANDS.md).

# Installation

To install fakeredis-py, simply:

```bash
pip install fakeredis        # No additional modules support

pip install fakeredis[lua]   # Support for LUA scripts

pip install fakeredis[json]  # Support for RedisJSON commands
```

# How to Use

FakeRedis can imitate Redis server version 6.x or 7.x.
If you do not specify the version, version 7 is used by default.

The intent is for fakeredis to act as though you're talking to a real
redis server. It does this by storing state internally.
For example:

```pycon
>>> import fakeredis
>>> r = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(version=6)
>>> r.set('foo', 'bar')
True
>>> r.get('foo')
'bar'
>>> r.lpush('bar', 1)
1
>>> r.lpush('bar', 2)
2
>>> r.lrange('bar', 0, -1)
[2, 1]
```

The state is stored in an instance of `FakeServer`. If one is not provided at
construction, a new instance is automatically created for you, but you can
explicitly create one to share state:

```pycon
>>> import fakeredis
>>> server = fakeredis.FakeServer()
>>> r1 = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(server=server)
>>> r1.set('foo', 'bar')
True
>>> r2 = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(server=server)
>>> r2.get('foo')
'bar'
>>> r2.set('bar', 'baz')
True
>>> r1.get('bar')
'baz'
>>> r2.get('bar')
'baz'
```

It is also possible to mock connection errors, so you can effectively test
your error handling. Simply set the connected attribute of the server to
`False` after initialization.

```pycon
>>> import fakeredis
>>> server = fakeredis.FakeServer()
>>> server.connected = False
>>> r = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis(server=server)
>>> r.set('foo', 'bar')
ConnectionError: FakeRedis is emulating a connection error.
>>> server.connected = True
>>> r.set('foo', 'bar')
True
```

Fakeredis implements the same interface as `redis-py`, the popular
redis client for python, and models the responses of redis 6.x or 7.x.

## Use to test django-rq

There is a need to override `django_rq.queues.get_redis_connection` with
a method returning the same connection.

```python
from fakeredis import FakeRedisConnSingleton

django_rq.queues.get_redis_connection = FakeRedisConnSingleton()
```

## Support for additional modules

### RedisJson support

Currently, Redis Json module is partially implemented (
see [supported commands](https://github.com/cunla/fakeredis-py/blob/master/docs/REDIS_COMMANDS.md#json)).
Support for JSON commands (eg, [`JSON.GET`](https://redis.io/commands/json.get/)) is implemented using
[jsonpath-ng](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng), you can simply install it using `pip install fakeredis[json]`.

```pycon
>>> import fakeredis
>>> from redis.commands.json.path import Path
>>> r = fakeredis.FakeStrictRedis()
>>> assert r.json().set("foo", Path.root_path(), {"x": "bar"}, ) == 1
>>> r.json().get("foo")
{'x': 'bar'}
>>> r.json().get("foo", Path("x"))
'bar'
```

### Lua support

If you wish to have Lua scripting support (this includes features like ``redis.lock.Lock``, which are implemented in
Lua), you will need [lupa](https://pypi.org/project/lupa/), you can simply install it using `pip install fakeredis[lua]`

## Known Limitations

Apart from unimplemented commands, there are a number of cases where fakeredis
won't give identical results to real redis. The following are differences that
are unlikely to ever be fixed; there are also differences that are fixable
(such as commands that do not support all features) which should be filed as
bugs in GitHub.

- Hyperloglogs are implemented using sets underneath. This means that the
  `type` command will return the wrong answer, you can't use `get` to retrieve
  the encoded value, and counts will be slightly different (they will in fact be
  exact).
- When a command has multiple error conditions, such as operating on a key of
  the wrong type and an integer argument is not well-formed, the choice of
  error to return may not match redis.

- The `incrbyfloat` and `hincrbyfloat` commands in redis use the C `long
  double` type, which typically has more precision than Python's `float`
  type.

- Redis makes guarantees about the order in which clients blocked on blocking
  commands are woken up. Fakeredis does not honour these guarantees.

- Where redis contains bugs, fakeredis generally does not try to provide exact
  bug-compatibility. It's not practical for fakeredis to try to match the set
  of bugs in your specific version of redis.

- There are a number of cases where the behaviour of redis is undefined, such
  as the order of elements returned by set and hash commands. Fakeredis will
  generally not produce the same results, and in Python versions before 3.6
  may produce different results each time the process is re-run.

- SCAN/ZSCAN/HSCAN/SSCAN will not necessarily iterate all items if items are
  deleted or renamed during iteration. They also won't necessarily iterate in
  the same chunk sizes or the same order as redis.

- DUMP/RESTORE will not return or expect data in the RDB format. Instead, the
  `pickle` module is used to mimic an opaque and non-standard format.
  **WARNING**: Do not use RESTORE with untrusted data, as a malicious pickle
  can execute arbitrary code.

--------------------

# Local development environment

To ensure parity with the real redis, there are a set of integration tests
that mirror the unittests. For every unittest that is written, the same
test is run against a real redis instance using a real redis-py client
instance. In order to run these tests you must have a redis server running
on localhost, port 6379 (the default settings). **WARNING**: the tests will
completely wipe your database!

First install poetry if you don't have it, and then install all the dependencies:

```bash
pip install poetry
poetry install
``` 

To run all the tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest -v
```

If you only want to run tests against fake redis, without a real redis::

```bash
poetry run pytest -m fake
```

Because this module is attempting to provide the same interface as `redis-py`,
the python bindings to redis, a reasonable way to test this to take each
unittest and run it against a real redis server. fakeredis and the real redis
server should give the same result. To run tests against a real redis instance
instead:

```bash
poetry run pytest -m real
```

If redis is not running, and you try to run tests against a real redis server,
these tests will have a result of 's' for skipped.

There are some tests that test redis blocking operations that are somewhat
slow. If you want to skip these tests during day to day development,
they have all been tagged as 'slow' so you can skip them by running:

```bash
poetry run pytest -m "not slow"
```

If you'd like to help out, you can start with any of the issues labeled with `Help wanted`.

There are guides how to [implement a new command](#implementing-support-for-a-command) and
how to [write new test cases](#write-a-new-test-case).

New contribution guides are welcome.

# Guides

### Implementing support for a command

Creating a new command support should be done in the `FakeSocket` class (in `_fakesocket.py`) by creating the method
and using `@command` decorator (which should be the command syntax, you can use existing samples on the file).

For example:

```python
class FakeSocket(BaseFakeSocket, FakeLuaSocket):
    # ...
    @command(name='zscore', fixed=(Key(ZSet), bytes), repeat=(), flags=[])
    def zscore(self, key, member):
        try:
            return self._encodefloat(key.value[member], False)
        except KeyError:
            return None
```

#### How to use `@command` decorator

The `@command` decorator register the method as a redis command and define the accepted format for it.
It will create a `Signature` instance for the command. Whenever the command is triggered, the `Signature.apply(..)`
method will be triggered to check the validity of syntax and analyze the command arguments.

By default, it takes the name of the method as the command name.

If the method implements a subcommand (eg, `SCRIPT LOAD`), a Redis module command (eg, `JSON.GET`),
or a python reserve word where you can not use it as the method name (eg, `EXEC`), then you can supply
explicitly the name parameter.

If the command implemented require certain arguments, they can be supplied in the first parameter as a tuple.
When receiving the command through the socket, the bytes will be converted to the argument types
supplied or remain as `bytes`.

Argument types (All in `_commands.py`):

- `Key(KeyType)` - Will get from the DB the key and validate its value is of `KeyType` (if `KeyType` is supplied).
  It will generate a `CommandItem` from it which provides access to the database value.
- `Int` - Decode the `bytes` to `int` and vice versa.
- `DbIndex`/`BitOffset`/`BitValue`/`Timeout` - Basically the same behavior as `Int`, but with different messages when
  encode/decode fail.
- `Hash` - dictionary, usually describe the type of value stored in Key `Key(Hash)`
- `Float` - Encode/Decode `bytes` <-> `float`
- `SortFloat` - Similar to `Float` with different error messages.
- `ScoreTest` - Argument converter for sorted set score endpoints.
- `StringTest` - Argument converter for sorted set endpoints (lex).
- `ZSet` - Sorted Set.

#### Implement a test for it

There are multiple scenarios for test, with different versions of redis server, redis-py, etc.
The tests not only assert the validity of output but runs the same test on a real redis-server and compares the output
to the real server output.

- Create tests in the relevant test file.
- If support for the command was introduced in a certain version of redis-py (
  see [redis-py release notes](https://github.com/redis/redis-py/releases/tag/v4.3.4)) you can use the
  decorator `@testtools.run_test_if_redispy_ver` on your tests. example:

```python
@testtools.run_test_if_redispy_ver('above', '4.2.0')  # This will run for redis-py 4.2.0 or above.
def test_expire_should_not_expire__when_no_expire_is_set(r):
    r.set('foo', 'bar')
    assert r.get('foo') == b'bar'
    assert r.expire('foo', 1, xx=True) == 0
```

#### Updating `REDIS_COMMANDS.md`

Lastly, run from the root of the project the script to regenerate `REDIS_COMMANDS.md`:

```bash
python scripts/supported.py > REDIS_COMMANDS.md    
```

### Write a new test case

There are multiple scenarios for test, with different versions of python, redis-py and redis server, etc.
The tests not only assert the validity of the expected output with FakeRedis but also with a real redis server.
That way parity of real Redis and FakeRedis is ensured.

To write a new test case for a command:

- Determine which mixin the command belongs to and the test file for
  the mixin (eg, `string_mixin.py` => `test_string_commands.py`).
- Tests should support python 3.7 and above.
- Determine when support for the command was introduced
    - To limit the redis-server versions it will run on use:
      `@pytest.mark.max_server(version)` and `@pytest.mark.min_server(version)`
    - To limit the redis-py version use `@run_test_if_redispy_ver(above/below, version)`
- pytest will inject a redis connection to the argument `r` of the test.

Sample of running a test for redis-py v4.2.0 and above, redis-server 7.0 and above.

```python
@pytest.mark.min_server('7')
@testtools.run_test_if_redispy_ver('above', '4.2.0')
def test_expire_should_not_expire__when_no_expire_is_set(r):
    r.set('foo', 'bar')
    assert r.get('foo') == b'bar'
    assert r.expire('foo', 1, xx=True) == 0
```
