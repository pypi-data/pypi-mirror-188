simple_NOAA
Welcome to simple_NOAA, a Python package for accessing weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through their API. The package includes a dataframe of station metadata, which can be used to request weather data based on location and time.

# Dependencies
pandas
request
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon
# Usage
The package includes the following functionalities:

stations_frame: A dataframe of station data from NOAA
stations_in_region(lat, lon, num_closest, radius): Returns a list of the num_closest stations within radius kilometers of the point created by lat and lon
yearly_request(search_type, station_list, year1, year2): Returns a dataframe of global-summary-of-the-year datasets for the requested stations
monthly_request(search_type, station_list, year1, year2): Returns a dataframe of global-summary-of-the-month datasets for the requested stations
daily_request(search_type, station_list, year1, year2): Returns a dataframe of daily-summaries datasets for the requested stations
Examples and testing of the package's functionality can be found in the testing.ipynb file.

# FAQs
What is the package's main purpose?
simple_NOAA is a Python package that provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through their API.
What kind of weather data can I request?
You can request global-summary-of-the-year, global-summary-of-the-month, and daily-summaries datasets for specific stations.
How do I find the stations I want to request data for?
You can use the stations_in_region function to find stations within a certain radius of a given latitude and longitude.
Is there a limit on how much data I can request?
The NOAA API has usage limits, please refer to their API documentation for more information.
Please let me know if you have any other question.
