## Flow2Spatial reconstructs spatial proteomics through transfer learning 

Flow2Spatial is the computational part of SPRING (global spatial proteomics with thousands of high-resolution pixels by microfluidics and transfer learning). 

It aims to reconstruct spatial proteomics from the values of parallel-flow projections in SPRING. Leveraging transfer learning, Flow2Spatial can restore fine structure of protein spatial distribution in different tissue types.
