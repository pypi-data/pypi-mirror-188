# drasyl

[drasyl](https://github.com/drasyl/drasyl) [dʁazy:l] is a general-purpose overlay network framework for rapid development of distributed
P2P applications.

By using drasyl developers can fully concentrate on creating distributed applications. With drasyl,
boundaries between IP-based networks will be eliminated and secure communication channels between
any peers will be provided. Zero-configuration is required to use drasyl. Developers can run a new
drasyl node without having to write configuration files or provide IP addresses of peers.

* Automatic Handover to most local Route.
* Overcomes Network Barriers (Stateful Firewalls, NATs).
* UDP Hole Punching.
* Port Mapping (UPnP-IGD, NAT-PMP, PCP).
* Communication is (PFS) encrypted.
* Reacts to Network Connection Changes.
* Asynchronous and Event-Driven.
* Lightweight.
