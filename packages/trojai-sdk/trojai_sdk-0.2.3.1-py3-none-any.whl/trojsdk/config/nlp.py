#TODO make support checks. Attacks and dataset should not be enforced, and an extra attribute should be added
which is an (optional) instance of a checks config (instantiated from some collection of checks Jsons).
If attacks is None, just the checks are ran. If the check config is None, the attacks must not be None and then
just the attacks are ran. If both are not None, the checks and the attacks are ran, with a special option of
adversarial checks which are special in that they take in the results of the attacks and return checks results.
