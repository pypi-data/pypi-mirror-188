  Parameters
  ----------
  data: Array
    An array with the values to be reduced.
  segment_ids: Array
    An array with integer dtype that indicates the segments of
    `data` (along its leading axis) to be summed. Values can be repeated and
    need not be sorted.
  num_segments: Optional, int
    An int with nonnegative value indicating the number
    of segments. The default is set to be the minimum number of segments that
    would support all indices in ``segment_ids``, calculated as
    ``max(segment_ids) + 1``.
    Since `num_segments` determines the size of the output, a static value
    must be provided to use ``segment_sum`` in a ``jit``-compiled function.
  indices_are_sorted: bool
    whether ``segment_ids`` is known to be sorted.
  unique_indices: bool
    whether `segment_ids` is known to be free of duplicates.
  bucket_size: int
    Size of bucket to group indices into. ``segment_sum`` is
    performed on each bucket separately to improve numerical stability of
    addition. Default ``None`` means no bucketing.
  mode: lax.GatherScatterMode
    A :class:`jax.lax.GatherScatterMode` value describing how
    out-of-bounds indices should be handled. By default, values outside of the
    range [0, num_segments) are dropped and do not contribute to the sum.

  Returns
  -------
  output: Array
    An array with shape :code:`(num_segments,) + data.shape[1:]` representing the
    segment sums.
