Welcome to the documentation for itmlogic!

These docs provide an overview of the python implementation of the classic Longley-Rice
propagation model. For in-depth detail on the engineering model we advise you to refer to the
original Longley-Rice documents provided in the repo folder named `References`.

Description
===========

The Longley-Rice Irregular Terrain Model is one of the classic radio propagation models. The
model is still widely used, particularly in industry. In comparison with other radio models,
Longley-Rice accounts for various physical effects that result from irregular terrain.

Statement of Need
=================

Many engineering models for wireless networks completely ignore terrain effects. While
software packages are available to address this, they usually need to be commerically licensed.
Those that are open-source are usually in less commonly used languages such as Fortran.
This open-source python package overcomes these limitations by providing an easy-to-use Python
version. Given the popularity of Python, there is a need for an easy-to-use Python version of
this model.

Setup and configuration
=======================

All code for ``itmlogic`` is written in Python (Python>=3.7).

See requirements.txt for a full list of dependencies.

Conda
=====

The recommended installation method is to use conda, which handles packages and virtual
environments, along with the conda-forge channel which has a host of pre-built libraries
and packages.

Create a conda environment called ``itmlogic`` type::

    conda create --name itmlogic python=3.7 gdal

Activate it (run this each time you switch projects)::

    conda activate itmlogic

Install any optional packages::

    conda install numpy fiona shapely rtree rasterio pyproj tqdm pytest

For development purposes, clone this repository and run::

    python setup.py develop

Run the tests::

    python -m pytest

Quick start
===========

If you want to quickly generate results run using area prediction mode type::

    python scripts/area.py

Or using point-to-point mode type::

    python scripts/p2p.py
