# This a super class used to hold methods that are used by all ERP/Client's entities
# This will be the default method behaviours to be used, incase the inheriting class chooses not override them

# Every ERP/Client entities/apis operate as 'CRUDly'.
# The methods are:
# A Create/New method - a method to make a new entry
# A Read method - a method to read entries
# A Update/Edit method - a method to update an entry
# A Delete method - a method to delete an entry

# An import method - a method to import entries

# This class will also have 'support variables'. These are variables used/set to enable the above CRUD methods work
# This class will also have 'support methods'. These are the getter and setter methods to 'support variables'

# It also has two methods that have to be overriden by inheriting classes,
# 1. payload - This method is used to return the default payload expected by the inheriting class
# 2. serialize - This method is used to convert the standardized CRUD operations payloads to the expected client/erp structure.

# Methods that do not return results i.e. return void, they instead return an instance of themselves. This is to allow for chaining of methods
