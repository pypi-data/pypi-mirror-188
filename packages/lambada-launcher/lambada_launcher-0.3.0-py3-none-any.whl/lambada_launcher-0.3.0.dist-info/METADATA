Lambada
=======

Lambada allows to launch and supervise multiple commands.

Launch with
```bash
python3 -m lambada
```

or
```bash
lambada
```


See [lambada.toml](lambada.toml) for an example file.


```toml
[analog]
cmd = "xclock"

[digital]
cmd = "xclock -digital"
```

Commands are described by their name and a `cmd` string field. Following options are availables :
- `shell` if set to **true** interpret the `cmd` in `bash` (allows to launch multiple commands and use bash features
  such as `|` or `>`)
- `persist` if set to **true**, task is not terminated when lambada exits normally.
- `detach` if set to **true**, task is detached from lambada and does not receive signal (`SIGINT` or Ctrl+C) send to
  lambada.
- `acquire` if set to **true**, monitor pre-existing task. Might be completed by `basedOn`. If no task is found, launch
  a new one.
- `basedOn` support two way to retrieve pre-existing task
   - `{method="grepCmd"}` will try to find a process with exact same `cmd` as defined
   - `{method="listenPort", port=1234}` will try to find a process listeing to the given `port`.
