This repository contains the code for IDM's human papillomavirus simulator, HPVsim. 

**HPVsim is currently under development**.

The structure is as follows:

- HPVsim, in the folder ``hpvsim``, is a standalone Python library for performing HPV analyses.
- Data is in the ``data`` folder.
- Docs are in the ``docs`` folder.
- Tests are in the ``tests`` folder.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install is simply via pip: ``pip install hpvsim``. Alternatively, you can clone this repository, then run ``pip install -e .`` (don't forget the dot!) in this folder to install ``hpvsim`` and its dependencies. This will make ``hpvsim`` available on the Python path. The first time HPVsim is imported, it will automatically download the required data files (~30 MB).


Usage
-----

See the tests folder for usage examples.


Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available at https://docs.idmod.org/projects/hpvsim/en/latest/.
