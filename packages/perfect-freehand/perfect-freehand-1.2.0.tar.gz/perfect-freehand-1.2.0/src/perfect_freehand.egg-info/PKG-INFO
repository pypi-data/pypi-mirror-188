Draw perfect pressure-sensitive freehand lines. (Python port)

This is a Python port of the

originally written by Steve Ruiz in TypeScript. Please reference the
documentation for that library for additional usage examples, links to
other implementations, and to support the original author.

When published to PyPi, the package name is "perfect-freehand" (since the "python" is redundant).
