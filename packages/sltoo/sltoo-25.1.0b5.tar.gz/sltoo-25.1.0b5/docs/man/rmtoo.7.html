<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">rmtoo -
requirements management tool</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>rmtoo</b> package is used to work on a set of
requirements and create artifacts from them.</p>

<h2>IDEA
<a name="IDEA"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rmtoo</b>
uses a different approach than most other requirements
management tools: it comes as a command line tool optimized
for handling requirements. The power of <b>rmtoo</b> is that
a typical development environment can handle the input files
with ease, as they are plain text.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rmtoo</b>
input files can be handled by mostly all standard *nix
commands like grep(1), awk(1) or sed(1). When replacing
text, commands like streplace(1) can be used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rmtoo</b> is
a tool. It helps everybody who understands Requirements
Management. It does not turn people into Requirements
Management experts. You have to know what you are doing!</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rmtoo</b>
gives everybody the unique chance to adapt the tools to
their needs and their processes because it&rsquo;s open
source. Often other tools force the user to change their
habits or processes. With <b>rmtoo</b> the user has the
control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The output of
requirements is handled in groups of requirements - so
called topics. Each requirement belongs to exactly one
topic. Typically a topic corresponds to one section; a topic
can have sub-topic (sub-sections). For further information
please consult the section <b>TOPIC</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">For handling
history and baselines an arbitrary revision control system
can be used (such as git, mercurial, subversion ...).
Nevertheless currently <b>rmtoo</b> supports <i>git</i> as
default for version access and statistics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Let one
thing do one thing.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rmtoo</b> is
<b>no</b> integrated, &rsquo;do-everything&rsquo; tool as it
comes with no GUI at all.</p>

<h2>OVERVIEW
<a name="OVERVIEW"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>rmtoo</b> requirements management tool works on a set of
requirements. It reads them in, parses them, preprocesses
them and checks them for syntactic and semantic problems. If
no errors are found, all artifacts which are specified are
generated.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This page is an
overview page. It gives a short overview of the uses of
<b>rmtoo.</b> Also it points to other man pages where
information about input and output files can be found.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION
<a name="INTRODUCTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The
<b>rmtoo</b> reads in a set of input files: requirements and
topics.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">These files are
plain text files stored in the file system. <b>rmtoo</b>
parses these files and runs some checks on them. These
checks include syntax checks, semantic checks and some
heuristics to provide ideas for improving the quality of the
requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">After passing
these checks, <b>rmtoo</b> outputs all configured artifacts,
like PDF or HTML documents, dependency graphs or
statistics.</p>

<h2>TOPIC
<a name="TOPIC"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rmtoo</b>
uses a unique method for describing and handling output: so
called <b>topics.</b> A topic is a description of one set of
related requirements. It has a name and contains text,
requirements and other topics. With topics it is possible to
build hierarchies of document output structures. In a PDF
file a topic may be one chapter which includes other topics
which are handled as sections, for example. Using HTML
output, each topic corresponds to one HTML page, while a
subtopic is a link to the appropriate (sub-)topic HTML page
it represents. When using graph output the requirements of a
topic are clustered.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This makes it
possible to define the output structure once (in so called
topic files) and use this structure over and over for all
different output artifacts.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
(by adding one additional line in the configuration file) to
create an independent and self-contained (set of)
document(s) from an arbitrary sub-topic. This makes it
possible, for example, to create a separate document for the
marketing department which bears no relation to technical
decisions and security requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Of course it is
also possible to map one set of requirements to a completely
different set of topics. This makes it possible to have one
set of requirements for internally used project
documentation and another for an external company which
delivers only one small part of the whole project.</p>

<h2>REQUIREMENTS vs DECISIONS
<a name="REQUIREMENTS vs DECISIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rmtoo</b> is
a requirements management tool in the sense that it is
possible to mange the typical requirements documents with
the help of the tool.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Strictly
speaking most so called requirements are not
&rsquo;really&rsquo; requirements but
&rsquo;decisions&rsquo;. Example: it is not a requirement
that a company want to build a EMail Client, it is the
decision of the marketing department.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a decision
is made, more decisions will follow (e.g. which operating
system to support, how should the GUI looks like, which mail
protocols to implement).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A requirement
is something, which is really needed in the sense to realize
the design decision which were made. Example: if it is
decided to use SMTP, there is a <b>must</b> that the
appropriate specification (RFC) is implemented. There is no
other way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Two
definitions:</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A
<b>requirement</b> is something which <b>must</b> be done to
implement / realize the previous made decisions. There is no
other way.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>(design)
decision</b> is something which is chosen from a list of
alternatives.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is very
important to show and vizualize what a design decision and
what a requirement is. <b>rmtoo</b> supports this
concept.</p>

<h2>TREES OF REQUIREMENTS / DECISIONS
<a name="TREES OF REQUIREMENTS / DECISIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Requirements
and decisions live in trees. There is always a root which
comes first (and typically describes the whole project /
product).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">All other
requirements and decisions depend on this. This first
decision entails other decisions / requirements - which
agains entail futher decisions and requirements. This is
what the so called requirements management process is
about.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In a project
all requirements and design decisions are connected in some
way. There are no separate ones.</p>

<h2>CONSTRAINTS
<a name="CONSTRAINTS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The possible
solutions of requirements are mostly always limited:
Software must run on a specific hardware or operating
system, a device must have a minimal shock resistance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The main
difference between requirements and constraints is, that
constraints are inherited: when a requirement has one
constraint, all the dependent ones inherit this constraint.
For example: if one device has a minimal shock resistance of
7G all it&rsquo;s parts must also have a minimal shock
resistance of 7G.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">It is possible
that a requirement has a constraint and this constraint is
also inherited from a parent. In this case it must be
individually decided how to handle this. Example: A device
must be designed which has a minimal shock resistance of 7G.
One component you already designed some time ago can be
reused for the new device. The decision whether this
component can be used or not depends on it&rsquo;s minimal
shock resistance: if the minimal shock resistance of the
device is lower or equal, it is possible to use this
component in the new device. If it is higher, it is not
possible to use the component to build up the new
device.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>rmtoo</b>
supports constraints. <b>rmtoo</b> supports automatic
constraint checking.</p>
