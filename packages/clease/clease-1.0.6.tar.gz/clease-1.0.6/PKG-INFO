CLuster Expansion in Atomic Simulation Environment (CLEASE) is a package that automates the cumbersome setup and construction procedure of cluster expansion (CE). It provides a comprehensive list of tools for specifying parameters for CE, generating training structures, fitting effective cluster interaction (ECI) values and running Monte Carlo simulations. A detailed description of the package can be found in the [documentation](https://clease.readthedocs.io/) and our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-648X/ab1bbc).

# Installation

Install the CLEASE code by executing

```bash
pip install clease
```

Alternative, CLEASE is also available through anaconda on [conda](https://conda.io) via [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).
We recommend installing CLEASE via conda on windows machines in order to simplify compilations, as pip tends to have
a hard time compiling the C++ code. Install into your conda environment:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge clease
```
## Graphical User Interface

Clease has a stand-alone jupyter notebook GUI, which is capable of performing most
of the standard CE routines. It can be found [here](https://clease-gui.readthedocs.io).

CLEASE GUI can be installed from PyPI or anaconda using one of the two following commands.

### PyPI

```bash
pip install clease[gui]
```

### Anaconda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge clease-gui
```

## Development

If you are a developer you might want to install CLEASE by executing the following command in the root folder of the project

```bash
pip install -e .
```

In order to run the tests, the testing dependencies should be installed. They can be installed with the extra
`test` option

```bash
pip install .[test]
```

There is an additional option for development purposes, `dev`, which contains some convenience packages.
All of the extras options can be installed via the `all` option,
i.e.

```bash
pip install .[all]
```

Note, that if you are using `zsh`, you need to [escape the argument](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30539963), e.g.

```bash
pip install '.[all]'
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are running on Mac and get the error

```bash
fatal error: 'ios' file not found
```

try this before installing

```bash
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14
```
