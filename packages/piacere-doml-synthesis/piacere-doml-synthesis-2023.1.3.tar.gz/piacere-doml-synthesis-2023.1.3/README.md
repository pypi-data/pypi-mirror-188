# PIACERE DOML Synthesis

This package provides experimental syntesis of a model
starting from an existing model (a DOMLX file, to be precise)
and user requirements (a list of functions that receive the `State` object)
using the [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) solver.

This package is intended to work with [PIACERE Model Checker](https://github.com/andreafra/piacere-model-checker).
