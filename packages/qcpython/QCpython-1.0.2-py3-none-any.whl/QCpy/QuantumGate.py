QuantumGate.py

A collection of quantum gates used to manipulate the state.

-------

Identity:
    Confirms the state of a qubit as well as used in expanding other gates to then be applied to a specific qubit within a quantum circuit.

PauliX:
    Switches the amplitude of the amplitudes of the states of |0> and |1>

PauliY:
    Changes the state of the qubit by pi around the y-axis of a Bloch Sphere.

PauliZ:
    Changes the state of the qubit by pi around the z-axis of a Bloch Sphere.

Hadamard:
    Hadamard gate puts the qubit that this gate has been enacted on into a superposition state.

CNOT:
    CNOT Gate allows for two qubits to be entangled with each other if the control qubit is greater than 0.
    This gate needs to be formatted based off of whether or not it is being calculated in little or big endian format of bit measuring placement.

SWAP: 
    SWAP Gate allows for two qubits to swap its values and properties.

Toffoli Gate:
    Acts similar in nature to the CNOT gate and will entangle qubits together, only it has two control qubits instead of one.

Phase Gate:
    Phase gate will rotate the qubit's amplitude based off of the value of theta.

S Gate:
    S gate is the equivalent to a pi / 2 rotation around the z axis for a qubit.

SDG Gate:
    DG gate is the inverse of the S gate and will change the qubits direction by -pi / 2 on the phase angle.

T Gate:
    T gate is a special use case gate that in implemented from the P Gate.

TDG Gate:
    TDG gate is the inverse of the T Gate that will impose the opposite rotation and shift of the gate.

RZ gate:
    RZ gate commits a rotation around the z-axis for a qubit.

RX Gate:
    RX gate commits a rotaiton around the x-axis for a given qubit.

RY Gate:
    RY gate commits a rotaiton around the y-axis for a given qubit.

SX Gate:
    SX gate in other terms is called a "square root of X (Inverse) gate" that creates a superposition of the qubit with a different positioning of the phase.

SXDG Gate:
    SXDG gate is the inverse of the SX gate and will inact the same logic as the SX but in a oppsite manner of what the original gate intended.

U Gate:
    U gate is given three inputs (theta, phi, and lambda) that allow the inputs to manipulate the base matrix to allow for the position of the enacted qubit
    around the bloch sphere representation.

RXX Gate:
    RXX gate is a 2-qubit gate that will rotate both of the qubits around the x-axis at the same time.

RZZ Gate:
    RZZ gate is a 2-qubit gate that will rotate both of the qubits around the z-axis at the same time.

CR Gate:
    CR gate is a controlled phase shift roatation gate that applies to 2-qubits.

CZ Gate:
    CZ gate is a controlled phase shift roatation gate that applies to 2-qubits.
