PyNSCQ
======

Python bindings to the NSCQ library (NVSwitch Configuration & Query library)
------------------------------------------------

Provides a Python interface to NVSwitch querying.

This is a wrapper around the NSCQ library.

Download the latest package from:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pynscq/

Note this file can be run with 'python -m doctest -v README.md'
although the results are system dependent

REQUIRES
--------
Python 3.0

INSTALLATION
------------

Pip Installation with python3:
- `python3 -m pip install nvidia-pynscq`

USAGE
-----
```
>>>#!/usr/bin/env python
>>>
>>>from pynscq.paths import nscq_nvswitch_device_uuid_path
>>>from pynscq import *
>>>
>>>devices = []
>>>
>>>@nscqCallback(p_nscq_uuid_t, nscq_rc_t, p_nscq_uuid_t, user_data_type)
>>>def device_uuid_callback(device, rc, uuid, _user_data):
...    label = nscq_uuid_to_label(uuid.contents)
...    devices.append(label.data.decode("UTF-8"))
>>>
>>>
>>>with NSCQSession() as session:
...    session.path_observe(nscq_nvswitch_device_uuid_path, device_uuid_callback)
>>>
>>>for label in devices:
...    print(label)
```

FUNCTIONS
---------
Python methods wrap NSCQ functions, implemented in a C shared library.
Each function's use is the same with the following exceptions:

- Instead of returning error codes, failing error codes are raised as Python exceptions.

```
>>> try:
...    session.path_observe(nscq_nvswitch_device_uuid_path, device_uuid_callback)
... except NSCQError as error:
...     print(error)
...
Uninitialized
```

- C structs are converted into Python classes.

```
>>>// C query struct
>>>typedef struct {
...    uint8_t bytes[16];
>>>} nscq_uuid_t;

# Python call to function and accessing members of ctype struct
>>>class nscq_uuid_t(_PrintableStructure):
...    _fields_ = [("bytes", ctypes.c_uint8 * 16)]
...
...    def __str__(self):
...        return "[%s]" % (", ".join(hex(x) for x in self.bytes))
...
...    __repr__ = __str__
```

VARIABLES
---------
All meaningful NSCQ constants and enums are exposed in Python.
