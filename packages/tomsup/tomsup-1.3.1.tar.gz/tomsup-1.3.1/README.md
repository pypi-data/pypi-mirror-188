A Python Package for Agent-Based simulations. The package provides a computational eco-system for investigating and comparing computational models of hypothesized Theory of mind (ToM) mechanisms and for using them as experimental stimuli. The package notably includes an easy-to-use implementation of the variational Bayesian k-ToM model developed by [Devaine, et al. (2017)](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005833). This model has been shown able to capture individual and group-level differences in social skills, including between clinical populations and across primate species. It has also been deemed among the best computational models of ToM in terms of interaction with others and recursive representation of mental states. We provide a series of tutorials on how to implement the k-ToM model and a score of simpler types of ToM mechanisms in game-theory based simulations and experimental stimuli, including how to specify custom ToM models, and show examples of how resulting data can be analyzed.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>How do I test the code and run the test suite?</summary>


tomsup comes with an extensive test suite. In order to run the tests, you'll usually want to clone the repository and build tomsup from the source. This will also install the required development dependencies and test utilities defined in the requirements.txt.


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest

python -m pytest
```

which will run all the test in the `tomsup/tests` folder.

Specific tests can be run using:

```
python -m pytest tomsup/tests/<DesiredTest>.py
```

**Code Coverage**
If you want to check code coverage you can run the following:
```
pip install pytest-cov

python -m pytest--cov=.
```


</details>




<details>
  <summary>Does tomsup run on X?</summary>

  tomssup is intended to run on all major OS, this includes Windows (latest version), MacOS (Catalina) and the latest version of Linux (Ubuntu). Please note these are only the systems tomsup is being actively tested on, if you run on a similar system (e.g. an earlier version of Linux) the package will likely run there as well.

  
</details>


<details>
  <summary>How is the documentation generated?</summary>

  Tomsup uses [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) to generate documentation. It uses the [Furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo) theme with a custom styling.

  To make the documentation you can run:
  
  ```
  # install sphinx, themes and extensions
  pip install sphinx furo sphinx-copybutton sphinxext-opengraph

  # generate html from documentations

  make -C docs html
  ```
