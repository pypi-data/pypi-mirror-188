- name: "Consistency"
  helpText: |
    Scores basic consistency between units of measurements and data values.

    Inconsistencies may be an indication of incorrect meta data, corrupted data, or sensor issues.
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "Values outside unit range": 2

- name: "Completeness"
  helpText: |
    Provides a basic indication of data availability / completeness.

    Missing data can be a sign for an underlying connectivity issue or sensor failure.
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "NaNs": 2
    "Data available": 2

- name: "Validity"
  helpText: |
    Indicates whether all data are values within the value domain specified by the business.

    Includes comparison to data types, bounds, etc."
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "Out-of-bounds (lower, physical)": 2
    "Out-of-bounds (upper, physical)": 2
    "Values in dictionary": 2
    "Data matches data type": 2

- name: "Integrity"
  helpText: |
    Indicates whether data are consistent with structural expectations (eg. no duplicate timestamps).

    Breaking of integrity means that downstream analytics might be unreliable even if the actual data is correct. For example, duplicate timestamps or out-of-orde samples will break most time-series analytics.
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "Source bad quality flags": 2
    "No out-of-order samples": 2
    "No duplicate timestamps": 2

- name: "Timeliness"
  helpText: |
    Indicates whether new updates are coming in timely.

    If the data capturing process is interrupted for a larger period of time (e.g. due to network issues) than it is possible the system can't recover from this causing gaps or longer periods without updates in the archived data.
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "Recently updated": 2

- name: "Metadata"
  helpText: |
    Scores basic metadata completeness.

    Complete and correct metadata are important to make your data discoverable and essential for interpretation, comparison and transformation of data. These should include operating ranges, limits, units and overall a view on asset relations.
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "Unit - Physical": 1
    "Limits - Physical": 1
    "Description": 1
    "Dictionary": 1

- name: "Accuracy"
  helpText: |
    Indicates how accurately data reflect the underlying physical reality.

    In particular, data compression artefacts will affect the score of this KPI.
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "Compression - flat archival rate": 1
    "Compression - value dependent archival rate": 1

- name: "Consistency+"
  helpText: |
    Scores consistency between meta data (eg. limits, units) and data.

    Inconsistencies may be an indication of incorrect meta data, corrupted data, or sensor issues.
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "Values outside unit range": 2
    "Improbable Limits": 1

- name: "Timeliness+"
  helpText: |
    Indicates whether new updates are coming in timely, and sensors give regular updates.

    If the data capturing process is interrupted for a larger period of time (e.g. due to network issues) than it is possible the system can't recover from this causing gaps or longer periods without updates in the archived data.
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "Recently updated": 2
    "Increased archival step size": 1
    "Stale data (distribution)": 1

- name: "Metadata+"
  helpText: |
    Scores basic metadata completeness.

    Complete and correct metadata are important to make your data discoverable and essential for interpretation, comparison and transformation of data. These should include operating ranges, limits, units and overall a view on asset relations.
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "Unit - Physical": 1

    "Unit - Functional": 1

- name: "Control loops"
  helpText: |
    Scores key metrics to score control loop data (eg. saturation, oscillation, valve stiction).

    Control loops are used to maintain process variables (PVs) at a desired value or set point (SP). Control loops are important for maintaining the stability of a system, and for consistently producing the desired outcome of a process. Bad data from control loops can be indicative for valve issues, suboptimal tuning, or incorrect sizing of the control mechanism system.
  type: KPI
  weights:
    "Control Loop Oscillation": 1
    "Stiction": 1
    "Saturation": 1
