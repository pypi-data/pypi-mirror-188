 A set of python tools for writing laboratory automation scripts that are clear, concise, and explainable. Code that achieves these goals should read like a pseudocode expression of the experimental procedure. Objects for control over equipment (or other software) should only expose a clear set of automation capabilities to make laboratory automation more robust and less frustrating.

The labbench module provides tools that support toward this goal through an object protocol and support functions. These separate repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code, Use of these capabilities among multiple experimental runs also helps to produced data sets with consistent structure.
