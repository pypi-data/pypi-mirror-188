    Example:
        For example, if there are two channel receivers with the same type,
        they can be awaited together, and their results merged into a single
        stream, by using `Merge` like this:

        ```python
        merge = Merge(receiver1, receiver2)

        When `merge` is no longer needed, then it should be stopped using
        `self.stop()` method. This will cleanup any internal pending async tasks.
