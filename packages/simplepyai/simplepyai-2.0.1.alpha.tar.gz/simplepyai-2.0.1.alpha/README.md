Hey guy !
I'm 15 years frensh dev !
I present you my project of neural network !
Just for the credit : LeLaboDuGame on Twitch -> https://twitch.tv/LeLaboDuGame
You can use this library on all your project !

EXAMPLE:
------
    nn = Neural_Network(x, y, layers=[3600, 64, 32, 64, 1], learning_rate=0.001, reload_last_session=False)
    nn.train(1300, show=True, save=True)
    print(nn.predict(image)) #return the output with a input (False if is < 0.5 and True if is > 0.5)


HOW TO USE:
---------
    TO START:
        -To init you must send 'x' and 'y' list (or numpy array).
        'x' is your input and 'y' is your output.

        -You must put the 'layers' (default is [2, 3, 1] 2 is the input and 1 the output neurone).
        The 'layers' is a list represent all of your layers with the number of your neurone example:

        [4,                                     3,4,10,1,                                       100]
         ^                                          ^                                             ^
         |                                          |                                             |
        (is for 4 neurone in the first layer)(some layers)(And the number of neurones in the output)

        -You can set the 'learning_rate' more is small more he understands, but it will take more repetition in
        training.

        -'reload_last_session' (default: False) is to reload the last session (if is the first sessions set to False)

    TO TRAIN:
        -'n_iter' is the number of train repetition

        -'show' (default: True) is to show how the graphique of your model

        -'save' (default: False) is to save your model (you can reload your model with the 'reload_last_session'
        in init.

Thank you very much to use this library !
