# so you wanna know whats going on in this file eh
# basically these are all functions the auth module uses to manage ya things
# because this is my file and im not regulated by sum community
# im gonna make the comments for this my way bozo
# you should still beable to understand it but youll def have fun reading it lmao
# ion finna be rude or out rageous or nun, you can lowk read this to your grandma no problem
# also if anyone sees this, please lemme know of any improvements i can make to the code, not the comments lol
# however if something doesnt make sense or i made a grammatical error, please tell me!
# also also i made this whole file without classes because i felt like it
# object oriented programming is cool and all, and by the gods i love classes
# but i challenged myself to make this without them and i also remember sum vid i watch about
# O.O.P. being bad so i decided to not use it
# only ecxeption to this rule is that the code used for the database connection uses a class
# i lowk dont know a different way without rewriting the whole database connection with a different module or sum
# also if you want to know useage for these raw functions instead of using the auth file
# i will have the useage to the 'server', 'frontend_session', and 'backend_session' functions in the comments on them
# and for all the other functions
# well if you want to use those you should beable to understand how to use them from their comments too
# and if you dont then you probably shouldnt use them

# ok so these are all the imports i use
# my fav lowk being josnpath_ng or cryptography
# the two modules that really pull their weight arround here
# like flask was lowk only used in earlier versions for the online server connections
# it came preloaded with a fye ass database api and so it became heavily ingraned into the base of alot of the functions
# but now i use sockets and cryptography, and i just havent felt the need to rewrite alot of the database code
# i mean it shouldnt be hard but im here now an nun else we gonna do

# checks how long its been since the time was set

# also i know i could put a try and accept statement with a pass
# but this way the thread will log the exception to the servers console
# and then i (or anyone else) can tell why the thread had an issue
# cause i lowk dont know if there are other potential problems with the checker

# and lastly the server function
# this is by far the biggest function
# this john will start off by setting up logging for the server
# then it will create a socket connection on the given address and port
# we also make some threads for cache checking and client handling
# then we define the client function, which will be used in a thread once set up
# the client thread will wait for a request from the client and basically just pass it to its own front end session
# no need to do anything crazy, however we do have special cases for ensuring clients are ended properly
# then we have the main loop that waits for a new client connection and sets up an encrypted connection
# once encrytption is done we pass the client to its own handling thread
# and thats it we are done!
