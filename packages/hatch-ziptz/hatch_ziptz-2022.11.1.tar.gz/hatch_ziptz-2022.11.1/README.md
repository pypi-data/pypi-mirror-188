# hatch-msgfmt
A hatch msgfmt plugin, simply replacing all po files with mo files, using msgfmt in `PATH`.

I had planned to originally integrate msgfmt.py, but that didn't work in my own uses.

If you find a way to get that working (or find any other issues in the plugin),
I'll gladly accept pull requests.
