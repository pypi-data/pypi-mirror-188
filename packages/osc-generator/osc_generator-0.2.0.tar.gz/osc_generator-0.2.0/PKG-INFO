# Description
OSC-Generator is a collection of Python tools to generate [ASAM OpenSCENARIO](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/openscenario/) files from vehicle data and an [ASAM OpenDRIVE](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/) file.
## Scope of Application
Currently, OpenSCENARIO V1.0 and OpenDRIVE V1.4 are supported.
Intersections may currently cause trouble but will be supported in a future release.
All features are tested in Python 3.7 on Windows 10.

## Installation
### PyPI
- OSC-Generator can be installed using pip
  ```
  pip install osc-generator
  ```

### Testing
- Additional dependencies for testing are required.
  - Required Python packages can be installed via pip:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
    ```
  - For testing, an ASAM OpenDRIVE file is needed. The file '_2017-04-04_Testfeld_A9_Nord_offset.xodr_' from [here](https://service.mdm-portal.de/mdm-portal-application/publDetail.do?publicationId=2594000) can be used by downloading a copy to the _tests/test_data_ folder. This file uses ASAM OpenDRIVE V1.4 format.
- Run pytest in the _tests_ folder or a parent folder thereof.
- When everything is set up correctly, all tests should run successfully without raising any warnings.

## Usage
- Class: OSC-Generator provides a Python class which can be used to generate a scenario in the OpenSCENARIO format from trajectories and an OpenDRIVE file. The file example.py contains runnable example code for usage of this class.
- CLI: 
  - OSC-Generator can use arguments provided via Python's commandline interface. For information on how to use this feature, see the output of the help function:
    ```
    python osc_generator.py -h 
    ```  
  - When installed via pip, OSC-Generator can directly be called in the console:
    ```
    osc_generator -h 
    ```
    
## Open Simulation Interface (OSI) Format Input 
- In order to use OSI format (.osi) input trajectory files with the OSC-Generator, the following steps are required:
  - install the Open Simulation Interface (OSI):
    - follow the installation instructions: https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/open-simulation-interface
  - copy the file 'OSITrace.py':
    - from "$PATH_TO_OSI_DIRECTORY\open-simulation-interface\format"
    - to "$PATH_TO_OSC-GENERATOR_DIRECTORY\OSC-Generator\osc_generator\tools\OSI"
  - run tests
  

- Usage of this feature functions as described above.   
- if OSI is not installed, the OSC-Generator can still be used with .csv input trajectory files.
