This is a PyTorch Model Trainer Class. It trains, validates input data.
It also saves the model after training to avoid retraining.
The class takes in 7 arguments i.e. device, epochs, model, criterion, optimizer, trainloader, valloader.
It has 2 methods:: (1). model_train_validate(). This train, validate data.It also plots learning curves.Finally it saves the model to avoid retraining it.(2). load_model().This loads your saved model from the above function i.e. model_train_validate().
