/// AllocatorFreeList is a memory allocator designed for allocating memory of
/// various sizes.
///
/// It preallocates a large chunk of contiguous memory during construction,
/// using a base memory allocator, and returns small portions of this memory
/// upon request. By controlling the timing and frequency of dynamic memory
/// allocations, this allocator aims to minimize the performance impact of
/// dynamic memory allocation on the system.
///
/// The class uses the free list data structure to keep track of which parts of
/// the preallocated memory are currently in use. If the preallocated memory
/// runs out, the class will allocate additional memory chunks using the base
/// allocator.
