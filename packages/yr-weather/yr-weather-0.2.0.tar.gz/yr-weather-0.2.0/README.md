# yr-weather
Retrieve weather data from Yr (by the Norwegian Meteorogical Institute) easily.
`yr-weather` is an API wrapper for some of the products from [Yr's API](https://api.met.no/).

**Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/yr-weather)**:

![Package version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/yr-weather)
![Python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/yr-weather)
![Package status](https://img.shields.io/pypi/status/yr-weather)

Supported products are:
- Locationforecast (v2.0)
- Radar (v2.0)
- Textforecast (v2.0)
- Sunrise (v2.0)

# Installing
To use `yr-weather`, simply install it using `pip`.

For Windows:
```
pip install yr-weather
```

For Linux/macOS:
```
python3 -m pip install yr-weather
```

# Getting started
To get started, check out the [documentation](https://yr-weather.readthedocs.io/).

For specific API Products, check their separate page on the documentation:
- [Locationforecast](https://yr-weather.readthedocs.io/en/latest/locationforecast/locationforecast.html)
- [Radar](https://yr-weather.readthedocs.io/en/latest/radar/radar.html)
- [Textforecast](https://yr-weather.readthedocs.io/en/latest/textforecast/textforecast.html)
- Sunrise

All functions and classes are also documented with docstrings and typed, for the best developer experience.

## Caching
By default, the library makes a cache file named `yr_cache.sqlite` in the working directory.
To disable caching, set `use_cache` to `False` like so:
```py
yr_weather.Locationforecast(headers=headers, use_cache=False)
```
MET's Terms of Service encourage using caching, to avoid extra load on the network. Therefore, this feature is not recommended.

# Future objectives (TODOs)
- [x] Add Read the Docs documentation
- [ ] Add further features from MET's API
- [ ] Improve support for earlier Python versions
