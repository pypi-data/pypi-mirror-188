## Asynchronous RMQ -> Websocket Proxy Server

Here is an implementation of typical websocket server which receives messages from RMQ and process them and send to connected websocket clients

In the current state WS server is capable of:
- Running a server instance which accepts websocket connections from clients and control them;
- connecting to RabbitMQ, creating Exchange and Queue and consume on it;
- receiving messages from RMQ Queue;
- processing received RMQ messages and send them to connected websocket clients.
