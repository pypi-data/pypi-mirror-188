## About The Project

![Pong Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacob-thompson/pong-atari/main/src/pong_atari/data/gfx/screenshot.png)

This executable program is an implementation of [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong), originally developed and released by [Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari,_Inc._(1972%E2%80%931992)) in 1972. This implementation was created using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) and hand-made [resources](https://github.com/jacob-thompson/pong-atari/tree/main/src/pong_atari/data).
