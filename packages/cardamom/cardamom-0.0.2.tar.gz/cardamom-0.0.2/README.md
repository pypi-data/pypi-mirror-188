# CARDAMOM

CARDAMOM is an executable Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) inference method, adapted for timestamped scRNA-seq dataset. The algorithm consists in fitting the parameters of a mechanistic model of gene expression: the simulation of the model, once calibrated, allows to reproduce the dataset used for the inference. The method has been introduced in [1]. It has been benchmarked among other GRN inference tools and applied on a real dataset in [2].
