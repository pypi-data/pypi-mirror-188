### Getting Started

#### Using HTML CodeSniffer

Below is the example usage using HTML CodeSniffer.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from automateda11y.pw.settings import Settings
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from automateda11y.pw.htmlcsrunner import HtmlCsRunner


def json_reports_dir():
    return Path(__file__).parent.parent.__str__()


with sync_playwright() as p:
    Settings.report_dir = json_reports_dir() + '/reports'
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("http://playwright.dev")
    data = HtmlCsRunner(page).execute()
    browser.close()
```

#### Using Deque Axe

Below is the example usage using Deque Axe.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from automateda11y.pw.settings import Settings
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from automateda11y.pw.axerunner import AxeRunner


def json_reports_dir():
    return Path(__file__).parent.parent.__str__()


with sync_playwright() as p:
    Settings.report_dir = json_reports_dir() + '/reports'
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("http://playwright.dev")
    data = AxeRunner(page).execute()
    browser.close()
```
