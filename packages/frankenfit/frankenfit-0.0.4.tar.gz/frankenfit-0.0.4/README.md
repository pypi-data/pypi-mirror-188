Frankenfit is a Python library for data scientists that provides a domain-specific
language (DSL) for creating, fitting, and applying predictive data modeling pipelines.
Its key features are:

* A concise and readable **DSL** (inspired by the pandas [method-chaining
  style](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/posts/method-chaining/)) to create data
  modeling **pipelines** from chains of composable building blocks called
  **transforms**. Pipelines themselves are composable, re-usable, and extensible, with
  a thorough [library of
  transforms](https://maxbane.github.io/frankenfit/current/api.html#transform-library)
  available for building, grouping, and combining pipelines in useful ways.
* Rigorous separation between, on the one hand, **fitting** the state of your pipeline
  on some training data, and, on the other, **applying** it
  [out-of-sample](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/260899/what-is-difference-between-in-sample-and-out-of-sample-forecasts)
  to make predictions on test data. Once fit, a pipeline can be re-used to make
  predictions on many different test datasets, and these predictions are truly
  **out-of-sample**, right down to the quantiles used to winsorize your features
  (for example).
* The ability to specify your pipeline's parameters as **hyperparameters**, whose values
  are bound later. This can make your pipelines more re-usable, and enables powerful
  workflows like hyperparameter search, cross-validation, and other resampling schemes,
  all described in the same DSL used for creating pipelines.
* **Parallel computation** on distributed backends (currently
  [Dask](https://www.dask.org)). Frankenfit automatically figures out what parts of your
  pipeline are independent of each other and runs them in parallel on a distributed
  compute cluster.
* A focus on **user ergonomics** and **interactive usage.** Extensive type annotations
  enable smart auto-completions by IDEs.
  [Visualizations](https://maxbane.github.io/frankenfit/current/transforms_and_pipelines.html#visualizing-pipelines)
  help you see what your pipelines are doing. You can [implement your own
  transforms](https://maxbane.github.io/frankenfit/current/implementing_transforms.html)
  with almost zero boilerplate.

Frankenfit takes some inspiration from scikit-learn's [`pipeline`
module](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.pipeline),
but aims to be much more general-purpose and flexible. It integrates easily with
industry-standard libraries like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org),
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) and [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org),
or your own in-house library of statistical models and data transformations.

## Example

Suppose we want to model the prices of round-cut diamonds using the venerable
[diamonds](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/diamonds.html) dataset, which is
often used to teach regression, and looks like this:

|       |   carat | cut       | color   | clarity   |   depth |   table |   price |    x |    y |    z |
|------:|--------:|:--------  |:--------|:----------|--------:|--------:|--------:|-----:|-----:|-----:|
|     1 |    0.23 | Ideal     | E       | SI2       |    61.5 |      55 |     326 | 3.95 | 3.98 | 2.43 |
|     2 |    0.21 | Premium   | E       | SI1       |    59.8 |      61 |     326 | 3.89 | 3.84 | 2.31 |
|     3 |    0.23 | Good      | E       | VS1       |    56.9 |      65 |     327 | 4.05 | 4.07 | 2.31 |
|   ... |     ... | ...       | ...     | ...       |     ... |     ... |     ... |  ... |  ... |  ... |
| 53939 |    0.86 | Premium   | H       | SI2       |    61   |      58 |    2757 | 6.15 | 6.12 | 3.74 |
| 53940 |    0.75 | Ideal     | D       | SI2       |    62.2 |      55 |    2757 | 5.83 | 5.87 | 3.64 |

```python
# To be.
```

See the [Synopsis and
overview](https://maxbane.github.io/frankenfit/current/synopsis.html) section of the
documentation for a more extended example, and then dive into [Transforms and
pipelines](https://maxbane.github.io/frankenfit/current/transforms_and_pipelines.html)
to learn how it works from the ground up.

## Getting started

```
$ pip install frankenfit
```

If you want to use the [Dask](https://www.dask.org) backend for distributed computation
of your pipelines:
```
$ pip install "frankenfit[dask]"
```

You may also need to install [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) for visualizations to
work. On Ubuntu/Debian:
```
$ sudo apt install graphviz
```

The author of Frankenfit recommends importing it like this:
```python
import frankenfit as ff
```

Everything you need to get going is available in the public
[API](https://maxbane.github.io/frankenfit/current/api.html), `ff.*`. You might want to
start with a [synopsis](https://maxbane.github.io/frankenfit/current/synopsis.html) of
what you can do and proceed from there.

## Documentation

The most up-to-date documentation, corresponding to the unreleased `main` branch of this
repository, is available here: https://maxbane.github.io/frankenfit/current/.

The documentation provides a detailed narrative walkthrough of using the library for
predictive data modeling, as well as a complete API reference.  Please check it out!

## Type annotations

The entire Frankenfit library is meticulously type-annotated and checked with
[`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io), making use of `Generic` classes where it is
sensible to do so. Aside from catching logical errors, the main benefit of this to users
is that modern IDEs like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can
interpret the annotations statically to report the types of expressions and provide
intelligent auto-completions.

![screenshot-vscode](docs/_static/sshot-vscode-intellisense-frankenfit-pipeline.png)

Frankenfit includes its own [mypy plugin](src/frankenfit/mypy.py). It is highly
recommended to enable it if you are using mypy to type-check your own code as a
Frankenfit user. Just include the following in your project's
[`pyproject.toml`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending_mypy.html#configuring-mypy-to-use-plugins):

```toml
[tool.mypy]
plugins = "frankenfit.mypy"
```

## Development

If you're *not* hacking on the Frankenfit codebase itself, and just want to build or
install it from source, `$ pip build .`, `$ pip sdist .`, `$ pip install .` should all
work out of the box without creating any special needs, as long as you're using Python
3.8+ and a recent version of `pip`.

To get started with hacking on Frankenfit itself, make sure that the `python3.10`
binary is on your path, clone this repo, and run:

```
# this just creates a venv and does `pip install -e ".[dev]"` and `pre-commit install`
$ ./setup-venv-dev python3.10
$ source ./.venv-dev/bin/activate
```

From there you may run tests with `$ tox -e py`, `$ tox mypy`, and so on.

The setup script automatically installs git pre-commit hooks. When you run `$ git
commit`, a few linters will run, possibly modifying the source. If files are modified by
the linters, it is necessary to `$ git add` them to staging again and re-run `$ git
commit`.

### Tests

We use the [`pytest`](pytest.org) testing framework together with the [`tox`](tox.wiki)
(v3) test runner. Tests live under `tests/` and are discovered by `pytest` according to
its normal discovery rules. Please be diligent about writing or updating tests for any
new or changed functionality. We use GitHub Actions to run tests on every pull request
and every push to `main`.

### Code style and linters

We follow [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) to the letter for code formatting and
additionally target [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) compliance, minus a few
exceptions documented in `pyproject.toml`. This is enforced at commit-time by
[`pre-commit`](pre-commit.com) hooks, and checked by post-push continuous integration.

### Dependencies and where they are defined

There are three categories of dependencies for the project:

* Run-time dependencies. These are the dependencies required of users to actually import
  and use the library. They are defined in `pyproject.toml` and will be installed
  automatically by pip when installing the `frankenfit` package. The set of required
  dependencies is small: `attrs`, `pandas`, `pyarrow`, and `graphviz`.

  * When installing Frankenfit, users may specify the optional feature (a.k.a. "extra")
    `dask` (i.e., `"frankenfit[dask]"`) to install `dask-distributed`, enabling use of
    the [`DaskBackend`](https://maxbane.github.io/frankenfit/current/backends.html).
    This is not included by default.

* Test-time and type-checking dependencies. Running the test suite requires additional
  dependencies beyond the run-time dependencies. They are declared by the `tests` extra
  in `pyproject.toml`.  Note that the `tests` extra depends on the `dask` extra, so that
  we may test Dask-related functionality.

* Documentation dependencies. Building the documentation requires [Jupyter
  Book](https://jupyterbook.org) and other additional dependencies, as declared by the
  `docs` extra in `pyproject.toml`.

* Developer dependencies, as declared by the `dev` extra. These are packages that a
  developer hacking on Frankenfit needs to make full use of the repository, including
  `tox` for actually running tox, `pre-commit` for running linters without
  actually making a commit, and so on. The `dev` extra itself depends on all of the
  other extras `[dask,docs,tests]`, so it suffices just to run `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
  on this repo to get started (which is what the setup script does).

### Writing documentation

Documentation lives in `docs/`, and we use [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) to
build it as a static HTML site. Documentation content is written in Markdown
(specifically MyST), but the Python docstrings, which are included in the API reference
section of the documentation, must still be in reStructuredText (albeit [NumPy
style](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html)), so it's a
bit of a Frankenstein situation. 🧟
