class Mixer:
    """
    This class will be responsible for containing all your tracks.
    You usually don't need to use this Mixer class unless you want to keep things organized.

    Notes
    -----
    - The name format of the generated tracks (if there is any) is "track {idx}" with idx being their index on the list of either input tracks or output tracks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `tracks` : Union[List[OutputTrack], List[InputTrack]]
        List of tracks. You can set this to None and pass a `> 0` number to either the `generate_out` or `generate_in` to generate the tracks instead.
    `generate_out` : int
        Number of output tracks to generate if wanted. Defaults to 0.
    `generate_in` : int
        Number of input tracks to generate if wanted. Defaults to 0.
