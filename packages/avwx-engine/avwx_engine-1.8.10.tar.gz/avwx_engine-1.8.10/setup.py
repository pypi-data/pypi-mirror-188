It sources reports from a variety of government sources, parses individual elements, and calculates additional information like flight rules and time range interpolation.\n\nAVWX currently supports:\n\n- Station data and search\n- METAR\n- TAF\n- PIREP\n- AIRMET / SIGMET\n- NOTAM\n- NBM (NBH, NBS, NBE)\n- GFS (MAV, MEX)\n\n## Install\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to download the library from pypi using pip:\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install avwx-engine\n```\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nReports use ICAO, IATA, or GPS idents when specifying the desired station. Exceptions are thrown if a potentially invalid ident is given.\n\n```python\n>>> import avwx\n>>>\n>>> metar = avwx.Metar('KJFK')\n>>> metar.station.name\n'John F Kennedy International Airport'\n>>> metar.update()\nTrue\n>>> metar.data.flight_rules\n'IFR'\n```\n\nYou can learn more by reading the [project documentation](https://engine.avwx.rest)\n\n**Note**: This library requires Python 3.8 or above\n\n## Development\n\nDownload and install the source code and its development dependencies:\n\n* Clone this repository\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/avwx-rest/avwx-engine\ncd avwx-engine\n```\n\n* Requirements:\n  * [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)\n  * Python 3.8+\n* Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies\n\n```sh\npoetry install\n```\n\n* Activate the virtual environment\n\n```sh\npoetry shell\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nThe test suite was built while using the `pytest` library, which is also installed as a dev dependency.\n\n```bash\npytest\n```\n\nThe end-to-end test files were generated using `util/build_tests.py` and placed into `tests/{report}/data`. Because Timestamp generation interprets the text based on the current date, Timestamp objects are nullified in the end-to-end tests.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe documentation is automatically generated from the content of the [docs directory](./docs) and from the docstrings of the public signatures of the source code. The documentation is updated and published to [engine.avwx.rest](https://engine.avwx.rest) automatically as part each release.\n\n You can also preview local changes during development:\n\n```sh\ncd docs\nmkdocs serve\n```\n\n### Releasing\n\nTrigger the [Draft release workflow](https://github.com/avwx-rest/avwx-engine/actions/workflows/draft_release.yml) (press _Run workflow_). This will update the changelog & version and create a GitHub release which is in _Draft_ state.\n\nFind the draft release from the\n[GitHub releases](https://github.com/avwx-rest/avwx-engine/releases) and publish it. When a release is published, it'll trigger [release](https://github.com/avwx-rest/avwx-engine/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow which creates PyPI\n release and deploys updated documentation.\n\n### Pre-commit\n\nPre-commit hooks run all the auto-formatters, linters, and other quality checks to make sure the changeset is in good shape before a commit/push happens.\n\nYou can install the hooks with (runs for each commit):\n\n```sh\npre-commit install\n```\n\nOr if you want them to run only for each push:\n\n```sh\npre-commit install -t pre-push\n```\n\nOr if you want e.g. want to run all checks manually for all files:\n\n```sh\npre-commit run --all-files\n```\n",
