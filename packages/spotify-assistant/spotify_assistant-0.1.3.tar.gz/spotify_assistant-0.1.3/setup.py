    'long_description': '# spotify_assistant\n\nA Python package that enriches spotify users\' music experience by allowing them to explore their listening trends via REST APIs implemented for Spotify developers.\n\nThere is one similar Python package, [Spotipy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy) that provides wrapper functions in Python for the Spotify API. This package contains a function for each possible API request, but does not combine any of these requests. Our aim is to create functions that combine multiple requests and provide additional insights for Spotify users.\n\n## Authors\n- Caroline Tang\n- Chester Wang\n- Jenit Jain\n- Julie Song\n\nThis package was originally created as part of the requirements of DSCI524 (Collaborative Software Development), a course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.
