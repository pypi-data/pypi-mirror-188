\Problem{The return of campanar de la Torrassa}


\Statement


\FigureR{width=5cm}{campanar} 
\emph{El Campanar de la Torrassa} is the bell tower of a church
located in the district of La Torrassa in the city of L'Hospitalet de
Llobregat. This bell tower is well known for continuously annoying its
neighbors with the sound of its bells.

\medskip 

Recently, this church is short of money. For this reason the
priest has decided to sell one of the two bells of its bell tower
(precisely, the one that had a basser sound). With only one bell,
it is not possible to give the time in the traditional way (see problem
\Link{LOOP}).
Therefore, the priest has invented a new form of giving the time: At
every hour, the bell sounds as many times as the hour is (from one
to twelve); also, the bell sounds once at a quarter past any hour, once at a half
past any hour and once also at a quarter to any hour. For instance, at 19:00,
the bell sounds seven times.
The same happens at 7:00. Also, at 19:15 the bell
sounds once, and at 19:30 and at 19:45 also sounds once.

\medskip

The priest has informed the neighbors that, with his new method, the
bells sound less times than before. For instance, if someone wakes up in the morning,
at 3:18, he will hear a bell sound at
3:30, another at 3:45 and four bell sounds at 4:00. You can check out
that this person has had to wait 42 minutes to be able to know which
time it is exactly since he has waken up, and that
he has heard six bell sounds.
However, with the traditional system, this person would have heard
thirteen bell sounds before knowing what time it is.

\medskip

Write a program that reads a time and prints the number
of minutes that someone has to wait to know exactly what time it is and how many
bell sounds has heard during this period.


\Input

Input contains various test cases, one per line. Each test case contains
two integer numbers $h$ and $m$ that indicate the time to wake up ($h$:$m$) and
satisfy $0\le h\le 23$ and $0\le m\le 59$. 


\Output

For each test case $h$:$m$, the output
must include a line with two integer numbers separated by a space.
The second integer indicates the number of minutes that someone
has to wait (starting at $h$:$m$) to know exactly what time it is.
The first integer indicates the number of bell sounds that have been
heard in this period of time.


\Sample

\Observation

This problem is from the semifinals of the 4th UPC Programming Competition 
and concludes the Trilogy of El campanar de la Torrassa. Jordi Petit has denied
the rumors which say that he is preparing a prequel.
