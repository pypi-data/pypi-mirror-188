\Problem{Students}

\Statement

Using the definition

\begin{lstlisting}
    struct Student {
        int idn;
        string name;
        double mark;        // The mark is a value between 0 and 10, or -1 that represents NP
        bool repeater;
    };
\end{lstlisting}

implement the procedure

\begin{lstlisting}
    void information(const vector<Student>& stu, double& min, double& max, double& avg)
\end{lstlisting}

that computes the minimal mark (|min|), the maximal mark (|max|) and the
average mark (|avg|) of all the students of the table stu that have taken
the examn and that are not repeaters. If there is not any student that has
these requirements, the value of these parameters must be $-1$.
