\Problem{El campanar de la Torrassa fights back}


\Statement


\FigureR{width=5cm}{campanar} 
\emph{El Campanar de la Torrassa} is the bell tower of a church
located in the district of La Torrassa in the city of L'Hospitalet de
Llobregat. This bell tower is well known for continuously annoying its
neighbors with the sound of its bells.

\medskip 

Recently, the priest of this church has decided to start a collection
in order to buy a new bell of iron to put in the highest part
of the bell tower. He wants that this bell sounds every time
the needles of the clock are overlapped. Thus, for instance, the new bell should
sound at 12:00 and about 13:05. According to the priest, this
innovation will double the number of believers in mass (which
should not be very difficult because his church is empty almost always).

\medskip

Before giving the money to the priest of La Torrassa, the
bishopric is interested in knowing the number of times that this bell
will sound in a long periode of time. In particular,
the bishopric needs a program that, given a starting time and a length,
counts the number of times that the new
bell will sound in this period of time.
It is necessary to take into account that, because of the
delay inherent to the movement of the hammer towards the bell, the new
bell will sound thirty nine miliseconds after the needles of the clock
overlap.



\Input

Input is formed by different test cases, one per line.
Each test case consists of three integer numbers $h$, $m$ and $t$. $h$ and $m$ 
represent the starting time 
($h$:$m$) and satisfy $0\le h\le 23$ and $0\le m\le 59$. $t$
represents the length, in minutes, of the time that must be measured and satisfies
$0\le t \le2^{30}$. 

\Output

For each test case, $h$, $m$, $t$,
the output must include a line with an integer indicating
the number of times that the new bell will sound starting at
$h$:$m$ and for a legth of $t$ minutes.


\Observation

This problem is from the 3rd Programming Competition of the UPC.
