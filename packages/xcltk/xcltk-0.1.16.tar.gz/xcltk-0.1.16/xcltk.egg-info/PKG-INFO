        xcltk is a toolkit for XClone (**warning: under development, not stable**)
        
        All release notes are available at [doc/release.rst][release]
        
        ## Installation
        
        xcltk is avaliable through [pypi][pypi]. To install, type the following command 
        line, and add `-U` for upgrading:
        
        ```shell
        pip install -U xcltk
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can install from this GitHub repository for latest (often 
        development) version by following command line
        
        ```shell
        pip install -U git+https://github.com/hxj5/xcltk
        ```
        
        In either case, if you don't have write permission for your current Python environment,
         we suggest creating a separate [conda][conda] environment or add --user for your 
        current one.
